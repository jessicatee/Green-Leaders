Green Leaders - Make a pledge app

----------------------------------

To encourage young people to be more environmentally friendly, an app has been suggested
so that they can "Make a green pledge". This will allow young people to be educated on and to 
commit to being more environmentally friendly, and challenging them to do so more in everyday life.

User Story 1:

environmentally friendly.

User Story 2:
As an administrator I want to be able to capture and store social media usernames and emails so that I can distribute newsletters and show how many users have made a pledge.


Extras
